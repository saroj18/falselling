        {
          question: "What materials are used for false ceilings?",
          answer:
            "We use various materials including gypsum boards, PVC panels, metal tiles, acoustic panels, and wooden panels. Each material has specific benefits - gypsum for versatility, PVC for moisture resistance, metal for durability, and wood for natural aesthetics.",
        },
        {
          question: "Do you provide services across Nepal?",

        {
          question: "Is the installation process messy?",
          answer:

          question: "Can false ceiling be installed in existing homes?",

          answer:
            "Quality false ceilings can last 15-25 years with proper maintenance. Gypsum and metal ceilings typically have longer lifespans compared to PVC, which may need replacement after 10-15 years.",

        {
          question: "How do I maintain my false ceiling?",
          answer:

        },
        {
          question: "What if panels get damaged?",
          answer:

          question: "Are false ceilings suitable for Nepal's climate?",

          question: "Can false ceilings support heavy fixtures?",
          answer:
